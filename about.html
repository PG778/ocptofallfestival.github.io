            The Old Colony PTO is dedicated to enriching and supporting the
            students and staff at OC. During the 2022-2023 school year fifteen
            grants were funded for over $13,800! A few of the other activities
            the PTO sponsored were the Music of Our Lives’ photo booth and Cool
            Lick’s Ice Cream Truck as fun treats for the students and staff.
            <br /><br />$5,000 in senior scholarships were given out and the
            seniors were treated to events throughout the year including a movie
            night at Star’s Drive In and a Cuttyhunk Ferry harbor cruise. The
            PTO also supports the greater OC community with the Old Colony PTO
            Fall Family Festival, participating in the National Honors Society’s
            Trick or Treat and funding the NHS Winter Wonderland.
